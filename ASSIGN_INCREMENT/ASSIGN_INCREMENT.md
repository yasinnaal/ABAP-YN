Instead of the addition VARYING, the statement ASSIGN should be used in the loop with the addition INCREMENT.

Example

In the first DO loop, subareas of the data object text are edited using offset/length access. The addition RANGE must 
be specified here. In the second DO loop, the program accesses the components of the data object text. In this case,
it is not necessary to specify RANGE. The third DO loop shows how the 
functions of the second loop can be programmed using the statement ASSIGN INCREMENT.
